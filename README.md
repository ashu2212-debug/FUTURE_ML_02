📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on building a Support Ticket Classification System using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning.
The goal is to automatically classify customer support tickets into predefined categories based on the text content of the ticket.

Such systems help organizations:

Reduce manual effort

Improve response time

Route tickets to the right team efficiently
